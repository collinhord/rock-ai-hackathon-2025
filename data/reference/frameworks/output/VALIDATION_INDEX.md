## Questions & Support

### Common Questions

**Q: How confident are we that concepts are truly present?**  
A: Very confident - 596 evidence points across multiple search methods. See `taxonomy_validation_analysis.md` for details.

**Q: Why didn't the framework analysis find these?**  
A: It searched for exact terminology matches. Semantic search reveals equivalent concepts under different names. See `framework_vs_taxonomy_comparison.md`.

**Q: Should we do anything at all?**  
A: Yes - Priority 1 optimizations improve framework alignment with minimal effort. See `taxonomy_optimization_plan.md`.

**Q: Can this validation be trusted?**  
A: Yes - methodology includes exact matching, synonym matching, related terms, annotation search, and distributed representation checks. See `VALIDATION_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` (Validation Methodology section).
