## Your Frameworks

Add your framework documentation below:

### Cambridge Mathematics Ontology
- **Authors:** Jameson, E., Horsman, R., Macey, D., Gould, T., Rushton, N., Rycroft-Smith, L., Majewska, D., Stevens, B., & McClure, L.
- **Organization:** Cambridge Mathematics
- **Year:** 2019
- **Title:** "Ontology: Structure and meaning in the Cambridge Mathematics Framework"
- **URL:** https://www.cambridgemaths.org/Images/ontology.pdf
- **Type:** Framework ontology and methodology
- **Focus:** Graph-based representation of mathematics as a connected web of ideas using "waypoints" (learning nodes), themes (connections), and multiple layers (mathematical ideas, research, glossary, curriculum)
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Waypoints as places where learners acquire knowledge, familiarity or expertise
  - Exploratory waypoints (informal/playful idea development)
  - Landmark waypoints (bringing ideas together)
  - Connected dependencies and constellations of ideas
  - Research-informed design and formative evaluation
- **Notes:** Particularly relevant for taxonomy design as it provides a sophisticated ontological framework for structuring mathematical knowledge with explicit attention to learning progressions, conceptual connections, and research grounding. Uses Neo4j graph database and custom visualization tools (CMF Nexus).
