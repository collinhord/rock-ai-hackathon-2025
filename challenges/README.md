## 🎯 Challenge Completion Workflow

1. **Consult Master Agent**
   - Ask which agent to use
   - Get starter prompts

2. **Set Up Specialized Agent** (if not already done)
   - Follow setup instructions
   - Test with simple query

3. **Execute Challenge**
   - Try starter prompt
   - Document in `prompts.md`
   - Save response in `results.md`

4. **Iterate** (if needed)
   - Return to Master Agent for refinement
   - Try improved prompt
   - Document improvements

5. **Document Learning**
   - Write reflection in `reflections.md`
   - Take screenshots for scavenger hunt
   - Note what worked and why

6. **Update Progress**
   - Check off challenge in this README
   - Commit your work
   - Move to next challenge

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Time Management
- **Don't get stuck** on one challenge for too long
- **Set time limits**: 10-15 minutes per challenge
- **Prioritize** work-related challenges if time-limited

### Documentation
- **Screenshot early**: Take screenshots before moving on
- **Document as you go**: Don't wait until the end
- **Be honest**: Document what didn't work too—that's learning!

### Iteration
- **First attempt rarely perfect**: Plan to refine
- **Ask Master Agent for help**: It's there to coach you
- **Compare before/after**: Show improvement in prompts

### Git Workflow
```bash
# After completing each challenge
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/rock-ai-hackathon-2025
git add challenges/[challenge-name]/
git commit -m "Completed [challenge-name]: [brief summary]"
```
