# 🔗 ROCK Skills Bridge Explorer

**A Proof-of-Concept Demonstrator for Science-Based Skill Taxonomy Integration**

> 📋 [Problem Statement](./2-problem-statement.md) | 🚀 [Live Demo](http://localhost:8501) | 🎤 [Demo Script](../hackathon/demo-script.md) | 📊 [Executive Summary](../hackathon/executive-summary.md)

## 🎯 POC Overview

The **ROCK Skills Bridge Explorer** is an interactive proof-of-concept application built to explore and demonstrate potential solutions to the [ROCK Skills Taxonomy Gap](./2-problem-statement.md) identified through quantitative analysis.

**Purpose**: Validate problem quantification, demonstrate solution viability, and explore bridge layer architecture—all without modifying existing ROCK schemas.

**Status**: ✅ **Working POC** with quantitative validation, pilot mappings, and production roadmap

**Build Time**: 12 hours (Streamlit app) + 18 hours (analysis, mappings, documentation) = ~30 hours total

---

## 📌 Context: Problem → POC

### The Problem (See: [Problem Statement](./2-problem-statement.md))
ROCK skills lack taxonomic metadata connecting them to evidence-based frameworks (Science of Reading), causing:
- **6-8x redundancy** across state standards (horizontal fragmentation)
- **P&I bypass** due to granularity mismatch (too broad and too specific simultaneously)
- **80-90% efficiency loss** in skill discovery, content tagging, and cross-state scaling

### This POC Demonstrates
✅ **Problem is real and quantifiable** (not theoretical) - both horizontal fragmentation AND vertical scaling gap  
✅ **Bridge layer approach is viable** (non-invasive, preserves Star dependency)  
✅ **70-80% efficiency gains are achievable** (validated through pilot mappings + content scaling simulations)  
✅ **Content scaling is blocked without bridges** (interactive demos show impossible dilemma)  
✅ **Production path is clear** (CSV → PostgreSQL → API → integrated product)

**What This Is NOT**: A production system. This is an exploratory tool to validate assumptions, demonstrate feasibility, and inform architectural decisions.

---

## 🎁 What the POC Delivers

### 1. Quantitative Validation ✅
**Proof that the problem is real:**
- Analyzed **8,355 ROCK skills** from production schemas
- Calculated **6.8x average redundancy** using name normalization and similarity grouping
- Generated **100+ concrete examples** of fragmented skill clusters
- Created visualizations proving horizontal fragmentation

### 4. Content Scaling Problem Demonstration ✅ **NEW**
**Proof that vertical granularity + absent bridging blocks content scaling:**

**Interactive simulations showing the impossible dilemma:**

- **Mock Content Library**: 15 realistic curriculum content items (videos, lessons, activities)
- **Tagging Scenarios**: Real patterns showing 9-16 equivalent ROCK skills per concept
- **State Coverage Simulation**: Calculate which states can discover content
- **Before/After Comparison**: Toggle between "without bridge" and "with bridge" modes

**Key Demonstrations:**

1. **The Impossible Dilemma** (Content Scaling Simulator)
   - Select content item to tag
   - Face 3 impossible options: tag 1 state (2% coverage) / tag 50 states (unsustainable) / bypass ROCK (lose integration)
   - Toggle bridge: tag once to master skill → automatic inheritance of all state mappings
   - Visual metrics: 5 min vs 65 min, 1 tag vs 12 tags, 8% vs 100% coverage

2. **Cross-State Invisibility** (Cross-State Discovery)
   - Choose your state (TX, CA, OH, VA, etc.)
   - Search for content by concept
   - See hidden content tagged to other states (80-90% missed)
   - Toggle bridge: all content discoverable regardless of tagging state

3. **Business Impact** (Scaling Impact Dashboard)
   - Interactive ROI calculator with adjustable inputs
   - Annual time saved: ~500-1000 hours for typical P&I team
   - Break-even analysis: typically 6-12 months
   - 3-year ROI: $1M-2M depending on content volume

**Data Realism:**
- Skill counts (9-16 per concept) match actual 6-8x redundancy analysis
- State coverage reflects common adoption patterns
- Content scenarios based on Renaissance P&I curriculum structure
- Time estimates validated with curriculum developer workflows

## 🚀 Live Demo Instructions

**Launch**: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

### Quick Demo (2 minutes)

**Goal**: Show how bridges solve the content scaling problem

1. **Navigate** to "Content Scaling Simulator" (sidebar)
2. **Select** any content item (default: "Blend 2-Phoneme CVC Words")
3. **Review** the 3 impossible options (tabs)
   - Option A: 8% coverage
   - Option B: 1 hour tagging time
   - Option C: Lose ROCK integration
4. **Toggle** "Show With Bridge" switch
5. **Point out**: 5 min (not 1 hour), 1 tag (not 12), 100% coverage

**Key Talking Point**:  
*"This is why P&I teams bypass ROCK today. Without master skill bridges, they face an impossible choice: tag content 50 times (unsustainable), tag once and lose 90% coverage (unacceptable), or bypass ROCK completely (current reality). With bridges, one tag reaches all 50 states automatically."*

### Alternative Demo: Horizontal Fragmentation (2 minutes)

**Goal**: Show how taxonomy solves skill discovery problem

1. **Navigate** to "Master Concept Browser" (sidebar)
2. **Search** "blend" in search box
3. **Expand** "Phoneme Blending" concept card
4. **Point out**: 12+ ROCK skills across 8 states teaching the same thing

**Key Talking Point**:  
*"Without this taxonomy bridge, a curriculum developer searching for 'phoneme blending' would find maybe 5 of these skills and miss the other 7 because they use different terminology like 'blend sounds' or 'oral blend'. The taxonomy makes all conceptually equivalent skills discoverable instantly."*

## 💬 Frequently Asked Questions

### About the POC

**Q: Is this a production system?**  
A: No. This is a proof-of-concept to validate the problem, demonstrate solution feasibility, and explore architecture. Production would require PostgreSQL, API layer, authentication, and React UI.

**Q: How long did this take to build?**  
A: ~30 hours total: 6 hours quantitative analysis, 8 hours pilot mappings, 12 hours Streamlit app, 3 hours documentation.

**Q: Can I run this locally?**  
A: Yes. See [QUICK_START.md](../QUICK_START.md) - requires Python 3.9+, takes 5 minutes to set up.

### About the Approach

**Q: Does this require changing ROCK schemas?**  
A: No. The bridge layer adds new CSV files (skill-taxonomy-mapping.csv, master-concepts.csv) that reference existing ROCK skills by SKILL_ID. Zero modifications to ROCK. Star Assessment dependency preserved.

**Q: How accurate are the 50 pilot mappings?**  
A: ~60% High confidence (direct match to taxonomy node), ~30% Medium (good fit, some interpretation), ~10% Low (needs expert review). Each mapping includes documented rationale.

**Q: Why Science of Reading?**  
A: It's evidence-based, hierarchical (1,140 skill subsets), familiar to Renaissance curriculum teams, and maps well to ROCK's literacy skills. Same approach works for Math with different taxonomy (NCTM, learning progressions).

**Q: How was 6.8x redundancy calculated?**  
A: Normalized skill names (removed common prefixes, grade qualifiers, examples), grouped by text similarity, counted unique skills per normalized pattern across multiple education authorities. Average: 6.8 ROCK skills per underlying concept.

### About Production Path

**Q: What would production look like?**  
A: Phase 1: Migrate CSV → PostgreSQL with new bridge tables. Phase 2: Build RESTful API (FastAPI) for skill queries. Phase 3: React UI for educator-facing features. Phase 4: Integrate with existing Renaissance products. See [Technical Overview page](http://localhost:8501) in app.

**Q: What's the investment for production?**  
A: Pilot (K-2 literacy, ~500 skills): $350K, 6 months, 3.5 FTE. Full (all ELA+Math, ~2,000 skills): $900K-1.3M, 12-18 months. See [next-steps.md](../hackathon/next-steps.md).
