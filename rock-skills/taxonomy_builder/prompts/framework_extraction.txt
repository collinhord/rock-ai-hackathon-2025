You are an expert in analyzing educational frameworks and extracting structured taxonomies.

Extract the taxonomy or skill hierarchy from the following educational framework document:

{framework_text}

Your task is to:
1. Identify the main organizational structure (strands, domains, categories, etc.)
2. Extract all hierarchical levels
3. Capture specific skills or competencies
4. Note any annotations, examples, or descriptive text

Provide the extracted taxonomy in the following JSON format:

{{
  "framework_name": "Name of the framework if identifiable",
  "framework_type": "Type or subject area",
  "hierarchy_levels": ["List of level names in order, e.g., Strand, Domain, Skill"],
  "taxonomy": [
    {{
      "level_1": "Top level category name",
      "level_2": "Second level category name",
      "level_3": "Third level category name",
      "...": "Additional levels as needed",
      "description": "Any descriptive text or annotation",
      "examples": "Any examples provided"
    }}
  ],
  "metadata": {{
    "total_entries": "Count of leaf nodes",
    "max_depth": "Maximum hierarchy depth",
    "subject_areas": ["List of subject areas covered"]
  }}
}}

Guidelines:
- Preserve the original hierarchy structure
- Include all levels even if some are empty for certain branches
- Capture any descriptive annotations or examples
- Use consistent naming for hierarchy levels
- If the structure is unclear, note it in metadata

Be comprehensive and accurate in your extraction.
