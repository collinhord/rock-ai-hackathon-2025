You are an expert in educational taxonomy design and structure. Your task is to analyze a taxonomy structure and provide comprehensive feedback.

Analyze the following taxonomy structure:

{taxonomy_summary}

Please provide your analysis in JSON format with the following structure:

{{
  "issues": [
    {{
      "severity": "error|warning|info",
      "category": "hierarchy|naming|coverage|logic",
      "description": "Description of the issue",
      "affected_nodes": ["list of affected node names"]
    }}
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    {{
      "type": "structural|naming|organizational",
      "description": "Specific suggestion for improvement",
      "rationale": "Why this would improve the taxonomy"
    }}
  ],
  "strengths": [
    "List of well-designed aspects of the taxonomy"
  ],
  "overall_assessment": "High-level summary of taxonomy quality"
}}

Focus on:
1. **Hierarchy Logic**: Are parent-child relationships conceptually sound?
2. **Naming Consistency**: Are naming conventions consistent across levels?
3. **Completeness**: Are there obvious gaps in coverage?
4. **Depth Balance**: Is the hierarchy depth appropriate and balanced?
5. **Parallelism**: Are similar concepts treated similarly?

Be specific and actionable in your feedback.
