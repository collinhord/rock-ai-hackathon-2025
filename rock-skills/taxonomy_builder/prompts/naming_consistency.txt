Evaluate:
1. **Capitalization**: Are patterns consistent (Title Case, sentence case, etc.)?
2. **Part of Speech**: Are similar items using similar grammatical structures?
3. **Clarity**: Are names clear and unambiguous?
4. **Parallelism**: Are related concepts named in parallel ways?
5. **Length**: Are name lengths appropriate and consistent?
6. **Specificity**: Are names appropriately specific for their level?

Be specific and provide actionable recommendations with examples.
