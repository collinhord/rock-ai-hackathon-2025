## 📊 Key Talking Points

### The Problem
- **13 master concepts** represent the same learning objectives
- **212 skills** are fragmented across states (2.9x average redundancy)
- Content tagged to 1 skill is invisible to other states
- Manual tagging to all variants is unsustainable

### The Solution
- **Master concepts** act as a bridging layer
- **Automatic inheritance** of state-specific skill relationships
- Tag once → visible everywhere
- **No ROCK schema changes** required

### The Data
- Generated from **State A variant groups** (cross-state equivalents)
- Enriched with **Science of Reading taxonomy** for structure
- **LLM-assisted mapping** for accuracy
- **Confidence scoring** for quality assurance

### The Value
- **~3x efficiency** gain on average
- **100% cross-state discoverability**
- **Sustainable at scale**
- **Pilot-ready** solution

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Application won't start
```bash
# Check if already running
ps aux | grep streamlit

# Kill if needed
pkill -f streamlit

# Restart
streamlit run skill_bridge_app.py
```

### Page shows "data not available"
```bash
# Verify data files exist
ls -lh ../analysis/master-concepts.csv
ls -lh ../analysis/skill_master_concept_mapping.csv

# If missing, regenerate
cd ../analysis/scripts
python3 generate_master_concepts.py
```

### Import errors
```bash
# Verify you're in the poc directory
pwd  # Should end with /rock-skills/poc

# Check Python path
python3 -c "import skill_bridge_app; print('OK')"
```
