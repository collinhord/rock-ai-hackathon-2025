## Interpretation Guide

- **High-priority (>0.90)**: Very likely duplicates or near-duplicates requiring immediate review
- **Medium-priority (0.85-0.90)**: Significant overlap, may indicate redundancy or need for clarification
- **Sibling conflicts**: Concepts at same level under same parent should be distinct
- **Cross-strand**: High similarity across different strands may indicate misplacement
- **Parent-child**: Children nearly identical to parents suggest possible redundancy
