MC-ELA-0001,Skilled Reading,"The ultimate endpoint of reading acquisition, defined as 'the fluent execution and coordination of word recognition and text comprehension.' This is the level of proficiency that a reader typically attains in adulthood. Represents the tightly woven integration of all component strands working together automatically and strategically.",9-12,0,0,9-12,Medium,,,Skilled Reading,all,all,reading,"MC-ELA-0001,MC-ELA-0002",
MC-ELA-0002,Word Recognition,"One of two major bundles in the Reading Rope. Encompasses the skills needed to identify written words quickly and accurately. Includes three strands that work together to enable automatic word identification. Development progresses toward increasing automaticity - rapid, accurate recognition with little conscious effort.",K-5,0,0,K-12,Medium,,,Word Recognition,all,all,reading,,
MC-ELA-0003,Language Comprehension,"One of two major bundles in the Reading Rope. Encompasses the knowledge and skills needed to understand language, whether spoken or written. Includes five strands that work together to enable text comprehension. Development progresses toward increasingly strategic deployment - purposeful, intentional, schema-building use of comprehension skills.",K-12,0,0,K-12,Medium,,,Language Comprehension,all,all,reading,,
MC-ELA-0004,Phonological Awareness,"A strand within Word Recognition. The ability to detect and manipulate sounds in spoken language. This foundational skill enables students to understand that words are made up of individual sounds (phonemes) and sound units (syllables, onset-rime). Critical prerequisite for developing decoding skills.",K-2,0,0,K-2,Medium,Phonological Awareness,,,mixed,prose,reading,,
MC-ELA-0005,Decoding,"A strand within Word Recognition. The ability to apply knowledge of letter-sound relationships to pronounce written words. Involves using phonics knowledge to translate printed symbols into sounds and blend them into recognizable words. Improves with instruction and practice, becoming increasingly automatic.",K-5,0,0,K-5,Medium,Decoding,,,all,prose,reading,MC-ELA-0001,
MC-ELA-0006,Sight Recognition,A strand within Word Recognition. The ability to recognize written words instantly and automatically without conscious decoding. Develops through repeated exposure to words and strengthens as readers gain experience. Also called 'orthographic mapping' in contemporary research. Works in concert with decoding to enable fluent word reading.,K-12,0,0,K-12,Medium,Sight Recognition,,,all,all,reading,"MC-ELA-0001,MC-ELA-0002",
MC-ELA-0007,Background Knowledge,"A strand within Language Comprehension. The factual and conceptual knowledge about the world that readers bring to text. Includes knowledge of topics, concepts, and experiences that help readers make sense of what they read. Grows through life experiences, instruction, and reading itself. Essential for making inferences and building mental models of text meaning.",K-12,0,0,K-12,Medium,Background Knowledge,,,all,all,reading,,
MC-ELA-0008,Vocabulary,"A strand within Language Comprehension. Knowledge of word meanings in oral and written language. Includes breadth (number of words known) and depth (richness of understanding for each word). Grows through conversation, instruction, and reading. Facilitates both word recognition (helping decode unfamiliar words) and comprehension (understanding text meaning). Reciprocally related to reading experience.",K-12,0,0,K-12,Medium,Vocabulary,,,all,all,reading,,
MC-ELA-0009,Language Structures,"A strand within Language Comprehension. Knowledge of syntax (sentence structure), semantics (meaning relationships), and grammar that enables understanding of how language works. Includes understanding of how words combine into phrases and sentences, and how sentence structure affects meaning. Develops through oral language exposure and explicit instruction.",K-12,0,0,K-12,Medium,Language Structures,,,all,all,reading,,
MC-ELA-0010,Verbal Reasoning,"A strand within Language Comprehension. The ability to think about and manipulate language to draw inferences, make predictions, understand figurative language, and construct meaning beyond literal text. Includes inferential thinking, logical reasoning with language, and metacognitive awareness of comprehension. Becomes increasingly strategic with development.",3-12,0,0,K-12,Medium,Verbal Reasoning,,,all,all,reading,"MC-ELA-0001,MC-ELA-0002",
MC-ELA-0011,Literacy Knowledge,"A strand within Language Comprehension. Understanding of print concepts, text structures, genres, and literary conventions. Includes knowledge of how different types of texts are organized, awareness of author's craft, and understanding of reading purposes. Encompasses both print awareness (for beginning readers) and sophisticated genre knowledge (for advanced readers).",K-12,0,0,K-12,Medium,Literacy Knowledge,,,all,all,reading,,
MC-ELA-0012,Reading Fluency,"Not a separate strand but an indicator of overall reading skill level. The ability to read with appropriate speed, accuracy, and expression. Develops naturally as component skills strengthen and become automatic. Serves as an efficient assessment of overall reading proficiency. Applies across domains - as knowledge grows and skills are honed, fluency naturally increases.",K-12,0,0,K-12,Medium,,,Reading Fluency,all,all,reading,"MC-ELA-0001,MC-ELA-0002",
MC-ELA-0013,Automaticity in Word Recognition,"A developmental trend in the Word Recognition bundle. As readers develop proficiency, word recognition processes become increasingly automatic - carried out rapidly, accurately, and with little conscious effort. This frees cognitive resources for comprehension. Develops through extensive practice and strengthening of all Word Recognition strands.",K-12,0,0,K-12,Medium,,,Automaticity in Word Recognition,all,all,reading,"MC-ELA-0001,MC-ELA-0002,MC-ELA-0003",
MC-ELA-0014,Strategic Comprehension,"A developmental trend in the Language Comprehension bundle. As readers develop proficiency, comprehension processes become increasingly strategic - purposeful, intentional, and schema-building. Readers actively deploy comprehension strategies, monitor understanding, and build coherent mental models of text. Represents sophisticated, metacognitive use of comprehension skills.",6-12,0,0,3-12,Medium,,,Strategic Comprehension,all,all,reading,"MC-ELA-0001,MC-ELA-0002,MC-ELA-0003",
MC-ELA-0015,Reading Disability/Difficulty,Impairment in reading development stemming from weakness in or delayed acquisition of one or more underlying component skills. Metaphorically represented as 'fraying' of strands. Can result from severe weakness in a single strand or mild weaknesses in multiple strands. Weakness in one area can hold back development in other strands and prevent achievement of skilled reading.,K-12,0,0,K-12,Medium,,,Reading Disability/Difficulty,all,all,reading,,
MC-ELA-0016,Strand Interaction and Integration,"A core principle of the Reading Rope: strands do not develop independently but interact continuously from the outset. Growth in one strand often affects growth in others. For example, background knowledge introduces new vocabulary; improved decoding enables vocabulary growth through reading; large oral vocabulary facilitates decoding. Instruction targeting one strand may strengthen others. Represented by interweaving of strands in the rope metaphor.",K-12,0,0,K-12,Medium,,,Strand Interaction and Integration,all,all,reading,,
