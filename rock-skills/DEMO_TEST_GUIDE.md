## 🎯 Demo Script (2 minutes)

### Setup
- Have app already running
- Navigate to Content Scaling Simulator
- Select "Blend 2-Phoneme CVC Words"

### Script

**[Show Problem]**
"You just created a phoneme blending lesson. You need to tag it so teachers can find it. But there's a problem... 12 different ROCK skills exist across states teaching this same concept."

**[Click Through Tabs]**
"Option A: Tag one state - only 8% coverage, 11 states miss it.  
Option B: Tag all 12 states - takes an hour per content item, unsustainable.  
Option C: Bypass ROCK entirely - lose all standards alignment. This is what P&I teams do today."

**[Toggle Bridge]**
"With master skill bridges, everything changes. **[Click toggle]** Tag once to the master skill. Bridge automatically inherits all 12 state mappings. Same 5 minutes, but now 100% coverage across all states. This is the only way to make content scaling viable."

**[Point to Metrics]**
"5 minutes instead of 1 hour. 1 tag instead of 12. 100% coverage instead of 8%. This is why we need bridges."

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Content library not loaded"
**Solution**: Check that `/rock-skills/poc/mock_data/content_library.csv` exists

### Issue: Page doesn't load
**Solution**: Check console for errors, verify data_loader methods work

### Issue: Toggle doesn't update
**Solution**: Streamlit session state issue - refresh page

### Issue: Charts don't display
**Solution**: Ensure plotly is installed: `pip install plotly`
