## 📋 Overview

This repository contains my complete workspace for the ROCK AI Hackathon 2025, showcasing a **strategic, professional approach** to AI agent development and prompt engineering. Rather than ad-hoc experimentation, this demonstrates:

✅ **Systematic Organization** - Clear structure for documentation, agents, and challenges  
✅ **Version Control Best Practices** - Git workflow for AI agent development  
✅ **Comprehensive Documentation** - Every agent, prompt, and learning captured  
✅ **Reproducible Methodology** - Others can follow this approach  
✅ **Strategic Thinking** - Master Agent orchestrates specialized agents  
✅ **Learning-Focused** - Emphasis on understanding principles, not just completing tasks

## 📖 How to Use This Repository

### During the Hackathon

**For Each Challenge:**

1. **Consult Master Agent** - Ask which specialized agent to use
2. **Get Starter Prompts** - Master Agent provides examples
3. **Create Specialized Agent** - If not already set up
4. **Execute Challenge** - Use the specialized agent
5. **Document Your Work** - In `challenges/[challenge-name]/`
6. **Reflect** - Return to Master Agent for refinement and learning

**Track Your Progress:**
- Document prompts in `challenges/[challenge-name]/prompts.md`
- Save results in `challenges/[challenge-name]/results.md`
- Capture reflections in `challenges/[challenge-name]/reflection.md`
- Screenshot evidence in `challenges/[challenge-name]/screenshots/`

### After the Hackathon

**Share Your Learning:**
- Compile insights in `presentations/key-learnings.md`
- Create demo script in `presentations/demo-script.md`
- Document methodology in `docs/methodology/`
- Collect best prompts in `examples/great-prompts.md`

## 💡 Key Innovations

### 1. Master Agent Architecture
Instead of navigating documentation manually, a **Master Agent** orchestrates the experience:
- Context-aware guidance
- Prompt engineering coaching
- Strategic planning support
- Learning facilitation

### 2. Systematic Challenge Tracking
Each challenge has a dedicated directory with:
- Prompts tried
- Results obtained
- Reflections on learning
- Evidence/screenshots

### 3. Reusable Agent Library
All agent prompts extracted to simple `.txt` files:
- Easy to share with teammates
- Simple to import into Cursor
- Version controlled for iteration
- Documented for understanding

### 4. Learning-Oriented Documentation
Not just "what to do" but "why it works":
- Prompt engineering principles explained
- Examples with analysis
- Before/after comparisons
- Connections to real workflows

---

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

Through this hackathon experience, I'm developing skills in:

- ✨ **Prompt Engineering** - Crafting effective prompts with role assignment, constraints, quality checks
- 🤖 **AI Agent Design** - Creating specialized agents for specific tasks
- 🎯 **Strategic Thinking** - Planning and prioritizing for maximum learning
- 📚 **Documentation** - Capturing knowledge for sharing and future reference
- 🔄 **Iterative Development** - Refining approaches based on results
- 🌉 **Domain Application** - Connecting AI capabilities to EdTech workflows

## 🎤 Demonstration Strategy

### What I'll Show Others

**1. Workspace Organization** (2 minutes)
- Repository structure tour
- How everything is organized
- Version control approach

**2. Master Agent System** (3 minutes)
- What it does and why it's valuable
- Live demo of agent selection guidance
- How it teaches prompt engineering

**3. Challenge Execution** (5 minutes)
- Pick one challenge (e.g., Shakespeare Agent)
- Show the workflow: Master Agent → Specialized Agent → Results
- Demonstrate iteration and refinement
- Highlight learning captured

**4. Key Learnings** (3 minutes)
- Prompt engineering principles discovered
- What makes agents effective
- How this applies to real ROCK work

**5. Artifacts to Share** (2 minutes)
- GitHub repository walkthrough
- How others can use this as a template
- Best prompts and examples collected

### Why This Approach Stands Out

✅ **Professional** - Shows software engineering discipline  
✅ **Systematic** - Clear methodology, not random attempts  
✅ **Shareable** - Others can fork and adapt  
✅ **Educational** - Learning is captured and documented  
✅ **Strategic** - Master Agent shows higher-order thinking  
✅ **Reproducible** - Every step can be followed by others
