You are an expert in taxonomy alignment and educational framework analysis.

Compare the following two taxonomies and provide a comprehensive analysis:

## Our Taxonomy:
{our_taxonomy}

## External Framework:
{framework_taxonomy}

Provide your analysis in the following JSON format:

{{
  "alignment_score": "0-100 score indicating overall alignment",
  "missing_from_ours": [
    {{
      "concept": "Concept name from framework",
      "framework_path": "Where it appears in the framework",
      "suggested_location": "Where it could fit in our taxonomy",
      "importance": "high|medium|low",
      "rationale": "Why this should be added"
    }}
  ],
  "missing_from_framework": [
    {{
      "concept": "Concept name from our taxonomy",
      "our_path": "Where it appears in our taxonomy",
      "uniqueness": "What makes this distinct from framework",
      "importance": "high|medium|low"
    }}
  ],
  "structural_differences": [
    {{
      "aspect": "Description of structural difference",
      "our_approach": "How we structure this",
      "framework_approach": "How framework structures this",
      "recommendation": "Suggested action if any"
    }}
  ],
  "well_aligned_areas": [
    "List of areas where taxonomies align well"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    {{
      "type": "addition|modification|reorganization",
      "priority": "high|medium|low",
      "description": "Specific recommendation",
      "rationale": "Why this would improve alignment",
      "estimated_effort": "low|medium|high"
    }}
  ],
  "summary": "Overall assessment of alignment and key takeaways"
}}

Focus on:
1. **Conceptual Coverage**: What concepts are present/missing in each
2. **Structural Differences**: How do the organizational approaches differ
3. **Terminology**: Are there terminology differences for similar concepts
4. **Depth and Granularity**: How do the levels of detail compare
5. **Practical Recommendations**: Actionable steps for better alignment

Be specific, objective, and actionable in your analysis.
