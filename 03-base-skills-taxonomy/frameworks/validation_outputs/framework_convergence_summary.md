## High-Confidence Concepts (0 concepts)

No concepts found in 3+ frameworks.

## Moderate-Evidence Concepts (0 concepts)

No concepts found in exactly 2 frameworks.

## Single-Source Concepts (Weak Evidence)

Found 29 concepts in only 1 framework.

**Recommendation**: Seek additional evidence or flag for expert review.

Sample concepts:

- Decoding Unknown Words (from Scarborough Reading Rope)
- Decoding Challenges (from Scarborough Reading Rope)
- Decoding Strategies (from Scarborough Reading Rope)
- Fluency (from Scarborough Reading Rope)
- Balancing Decoding with Understanding (from Scarborough Reading Rope)
- Vocabulary Knowledge (from Scarborough Reading Rope)
- Language Comprehension (from Scarborough Reading Rope)
- Background Knowledge (from Scarborough Reading Rope)
- Comprehension (from Scarborough Reading Rope)
- Comprehension Strategies (from Scarborough Reading Rope)
- Connecting to Background Knowledge (from Scarborough Reading Rope)
- Language Structure (from Scarborough Reading Rope)
- Literacy Knowledge (from Scarborough Reading Rope)
- Verbal Reasoning (from Scarborough Reading Rope)
- Analyzing Theme Development (from Cambridge Mathematics)
- Vocabulary Knowledge (from Scarborough Reading Rope)
- Motivating Action (from Cambridge Mathematics)
- Word Recognition (from Scarborough Reading Rope)
- Word Recognition (from Scarborough Reading Rope)
- Multisyllabic Decoding (from Scarborough Reading Rope)

## Unvalidated Concepts (2041 concepts)

These taxonomy concepts were not found in any loaded frameworks.

**Note**: This may indicate:

- Concepts are more granular than framework concepts

- Concepts use different terminology

- Concepts are novel/custom to this taxonomy

- Need to load additional frameworks

## Recommendations

### Overall Coverage: 1.4%

⚠️ **Low**: Significant number of unvalidated concepts

### Action Items

1. **High Priority**: Review strong-evidence concepts for completeness
2. **Medium Priority**: Validate single-source concepts with additional frameworks
3. **Low Priority**: Assess unvalidated concepts - determine if novel or need different terminology
4. **Ongoing**: Add new frameworks to increase validation coverage
