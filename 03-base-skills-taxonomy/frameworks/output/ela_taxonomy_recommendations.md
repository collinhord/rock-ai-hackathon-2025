## Tier 1: Critical & Convergent Concepts (IMMEDIATE INTEGRATION)

**Priority**: Highest - These concepts appear in BOTH frameworks, indicating strong scientific convergence.

### 1. Reading Fluency

**Sources**: Both Duke 2021 and Scarborough
**Foundational**: Yes
**Integration Complexity**: low

**Description** (Scarborough): Not a separate strand but an indicator of overall reading skill level. The ability to read with appropriate speed, accuracy, and expression. Develops naturally as component skills strengthen and become automatic. Serves as an efficient assessment of overall reading proficiency. Applies across domains - as knowledge grows and skills are honed, fluency naturally increases.

**Proposed Taxonomy Location**:
- Strand: `Word Recognition`
- Pillar: `Automaticity`
- Domain: `Reading Fluency`

**Rationale**: Present in both Duke 2021 and Scarborough frameworks (convergent evidence)

**Action**: Add to taxonomy immediately as high-priority gap

### 2. Decoding

**Sources**: Both Duke 2021 and Scarborough
**Foundational**: Yes
**Integration Complexity**: low

**Description** (Scarborough): A strand within Word Recognition. The ability to apply knowledge of letter-sound relationships to pronounce written words. Involves using phonics knowledge to translate printed symbols into sounds and blend them into recognizable words. Improves with instruction and practice, becoming increasingly automatic.

**Proposed Taxonomy Location**:
- Strand: `Word Recognition`
- Pillar: `Phonics`
- Domain: `Decoding`

**Rationale**: Present in both Duke 2021 and Scarborough frameworks (convergent evidence)

**Action**: Add to taxonomy immediately as high-priority gap

---

### 3. Reading Strategies / Strategic Reading

**Sources**: Both Duke 2021 and Scarborough
**Foundational**: Yes
**Integration Complexity**: low

**Proposed Taxonomy Location**:
- Strand: `Active Self-Regulation`
- Pillar: `Metacognitive Skills`
- Domain: `Reading Strategies`

**Rationale**: Present in both Duke 2021 and Scarborough frameworks (convergent evidence)

**Action**: Add to taxonomy immediately as high-priority gap

---

### 4. Syntactic Knowledge / Language Structures

**Sources**: Both Duke 2021 and Scarborough
**Foundational**: Yes
**Integration Complexity**: low

**Description** (Scarborough): A strand within Language Comprehension. Knowledge of syntax (sentence structure), semantics (meaning relationships), and grammar that enables understanding of how language works. Includes understanding of how words combine into phrases and sentences, and how sentence structure affects meaning. Develops through oral language exposure and explicit instruction.

**Proposed Taxonomy Location**:
- Strand: `Language Comprehension`
- Pillar: `Linguistic Knowledge`
- Domain: `Syntax`

**Rationale**: Present in both Duke 2021 and Scarborough frameworks (convergent evidence)

**Action**: Add to taxonomy immediately as high-priority gap

---

### 5. Semantic Knowledge / Vocabulary

**Sources**: Both Duke 2021 and Scarborough
**Foundational**: Yes
**Integration Complexity**: low

**Description** (Scarborough): A strand within Language Comprehension. Knowledge of word meanings in oral and written language. Includes breadth (number of words known) and depth (richness of understanding for each word). Grows through conversation, instruction, and reading. Facilitates both word recognition (helping decode unfamiliar words) and comprehension (understanding text meaning). Reciprocally related to reading experience.

**Proposed Taxonomy Location**:
- Strand: `Language Comprehension`
- Pillar: `Vocabulary`
- Domain: `Semantic Knowledge`

**Rationale**: Present in both Duke 2021 and Scarborough frameworks (convergent evidence)

**Action**: Add to taxonomy immediately as high-priority gap

---

## Tier 2: Important Single-Source Concepts (NEAR-TERM INTEGRATION)

**Priority**: High - Foundational concepts from one framework that fill significant gaps.

## Tier 3: Supplementary Concepts (FUTURE CONSIDERATION)

**Priority**: Medium - Specialized concepts for future enhancement.

### 1. Attentional Control (Duke)

**Rationale**: Specialized concept from Duke 2021

### 2. Content Knowledge (Duke)

**Rationale**: Specialized concept from Duke 2021

### 3. Prosody (Duke)

**Rationale**: Specialized concept from Duke 2021

### 4. Working Memory (Duke)

**Rationale**: Specialized concept from Duke 2021

### 5. Skilled Reading (Scarborough)

**Rationale**: Specialized concept from Scarborough

### 6. Reading Disability/Difficulty (Scarborough)

**Rationale**: Specialized concept from Scarborough

### 7. Strand Interaction and Development (Scarborough)

**Rationale**: Specialized concept from Scarborough

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate (0-1 month)
- Add all 5 Tier 1 concepts (convergent evidence)
- Update taxonomy structure to accommodate new domains if needed
- Map to existing ROCK skills via batch mapping pipeline

### Phase 2: Near-term (1-3 months)
- Add 0 Tier 2 concepts (important single-source)
- Conduct validation with reading science experts
- Enrich metadata (complexity bands, skill domains)

### Phase 3: Future (3-6 months)
- Evaluate 7 Tier 3 concepts for inclusion
- Consider structural enhancements
- Continuous improvement based on new research

## Integration Guide

### For Taxonomy Maintainers:

1. **Review Tier 1 concepts** - Start with convergent concepts
2. **Check proposed mappings** - Validate Strand/Pillar/Domain assignments
3. **Generate master concept IDs** - Use MC-ELA-#### format
4. **Run batch mapping** - Map concepts to ROCK skills
5. **Validate mappings** - Review and refine skill alignments
6. **Update taxonomy CSV** - Integrate approved concepts
7. **Document changes** - Track what was added and why
