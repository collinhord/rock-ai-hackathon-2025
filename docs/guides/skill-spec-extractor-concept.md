# Skill Spec Extractor: Concept Overview

> **Making educational skills machine-readable at scale through AI-powered metadata extraction**

---

## The Problem

**Human-first, customer-facing skills have a high cognitive load to interpret quickly and over a large dataset.**

Educational skills in the ROCK system are written for human comprehension‚Äîteachers, curriculum designers, and content creators. Each skill description is a natural language sentence designed to communicate learning objectives clearly to people:

- _"Identify the basic elements of a story's plot (e.g., problem, important events)"_
- _"Use knowledge of word structure, word relationships, and context to determine word meanings"_
- _"Analyze how an author's choices concerning how to structure a text create effects such as mystery, tension, or surprise"_

While these descriptions are excellent for human readers, they present significant challenges when working with thousands of skills programmatically:

### Cognitive Load Challenges

1. **Semantic Ambiguity**: Same concept expressed in different ways across states
2. **Structural Complexity**: Variable sentence structures make pattern recognition difficult
3. **Scale**: 8,355+ skills require automated analysis, not manual review
4. **Contextual Interpretation**: Understanding what a skill actually teaches requires domain expertise
5. **Comparison Difficulty**: Determining if two skills are similar requires deep reading

---

## The Impact

**The right skill is difficult to find at the right time. Distinctions between skills get muddy.**

Without structured, machine-readable metadata, the ROCK skills system faces practical operational problems:

### Discovery Problems

- **Search Inefficiency**: Text-based search returns too many irrelevant results
- **Invisible Content**: Cross-state content discovery fails (e.g., Colorado content invisible to Texas teachers)
- **Time Waste**: Teachers spend hours finding appropriate skills for lesson planning
- **Missed Opportunities**: Relevant content exists but remains undiscovered

### Clarity Problems

- **Redundancy Blindness**: 60-75% redundant skills appear as unique entries
- **Granularity Confusion**: Some skills are broad concepts, others are narrow tasks
- **Relationship Gaps**: No way to know if skills are prerequisites, variants, or duplicates
- **Context Loss**: Can't filter skills by text type, cognitive demand, or complexity level

### Business Impact

- **80-90% efficiency loss** in content scaling and curriculum alignment
- **Ecosystem fragmentation** as each state builds isolated content libraries
- **Competitive disadvantage** compared to competitors with semantic search and adaptive learning
- **User frustration** leading to reduced engagement and product adoption

---

## The Hypothesis

**Skills can be described at scale using AI-suggested metadata tagging.**

If we can automatically extract structured metadata from natural language skill descriptions, we can:

1. **Enable Semantic Search**: Find skills by concept, not just keywords
2. **Detect Redundancies**: Group conceptually equivalent skills across states
3. **Support Discovery**: Surface relevant cross-state content automatically
4. **Facilitate Mapping**: Align skills to scientific frameworks and learning progressions
5. **Power New Features**: Adaptive learning, intelligent recommendations, learning pathways

### Why This Works

**AI Language Models** have demonstrated the ability to:
- Parse complex sentence structures reliably
- Identify semantic concepts and relationships
- Classify content along multiple dimensions
- Extract structured data from unstructured text
- Do this at scale (thousands of skills) cost-effectively

**The key insight**: Educational skills follow patterns. While each skill description is unique, the underlying structure is consistent:

```
[ACTION VERB] + [TARGET CONCEPT] + [QUALIFIERS/CONTEXT]
```

Examples:
- **Identify** [ACTION] + **plot elements** [TARGET] + **in stories** [CONTEXT]
- **Analyze** [ACTION] + **author's choices** [TARGET] + **for effect** [CONTEXT]  
- **Use** [ACTION] + **word structure** [TARGET] + **to determine meaning** [CONTEXT]

## The Plan

**Train AI to identify the verbs and attributes of each skill, and highlight the limits.**

### Three-Stage Extraction Pipeline

The Skill Spec Extractor uses a **hybrid approach** combining three complementary techniques:

#### Stage 1: Structural Analysis (spaCy NLP)
**Fast, deterministic linguistic parsing**

Extract core structural components:
- **Actions**: Verbs describing cognitive operations (identify, analyze, compare, evaluate)
- **Targets**: Nouns representing learning objects (characters, themes, arguments, phonemes)
- **Qualifiers**: Adjectives and modifiers (basic, complex, key, major)
- **Grammatical Structure**: Root verbs, direct objects, prepositional phrases

**Output Example**:
```json
{
  "actions": ["identify", "analyze"],
  "targets": ["plot", "elements", "story"],
  "qualifiers": ["basic"],
  "root_verb": "identify",
  "direct_objects": ["elements"]
}
```

**Cost**: Free (local processing)  
**Speed**: ~100 skills/second  
**Accuracy**: 95%+ for structural elements

---

#### Stage 2: Educational Classification (LLM)
**Context-aware pedagogical metadata**

Extract educational context and instructional attributes:
- **Text Type**: fictional | informational | mixed | not_applicable
- **Text Mode**: prose | poetry | not_applicable
- **Text Genre**: narrative | expository | argumentative | etc.
- **Skill Domain**: reading | writing | speaking | listening | language
- **Task Complexity**: basic | intermediate | complex
- **Cognitive Demand**: recall | comprehension | application | analysis | synthesis | evaluation
- **Support Level**: independent | scaffolded | modeled

**Output Example**:
```json
{
  "text_type": "fictional",
  "text_mode": "prose",
  "text_genre": "narrative",
  "skill_domain": "reading",
  "task_complexity": "basic",
  "cognitive_demand": "comprehension",
  "support_level": "independent"
}
```

**Cost**: ~$0.003 per skill ($9-12 for 3,000 skills)  
**Speed**: ~12-15 minutes for 300 skills  
**Accuracy**: 90%+ with validation

---

#### Stage 3: Specification Rules (Pattern Matching)
**Deterministic classification based on known patterns**

Apply rule-based logic for specific attributes:
- **Complexity Band**: K-2 | 3-5 | 6-8 | 9-12 (from grade level)
- **Support Level**: Extract from skill text patterns ("with scaffolding", "independently")

**Output Example**:
```json
{
  "complexity_band": "K-2",
  "support_level": "scaffolded"
}
```

**Cost**: Free (rule-based)  
**Speed**: Instant  
**Accuracy**: 100% (for defined rules)

---

### Comprehensive Output: 23 Metadata Fields

**Combined Result for Each Skill**:

| Category | Fields | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Core Identifiers** | SKILL_ID, SKILL_NAME, SKILL_AREA_NAME, GRADE_LEVEL | Direct copy |
| **Structural Components** | actions, targets, qualifiers, root_verb, direct_objects, prepositional_phrases, key_concepts, complexity_markers | spaCy |
| **Educational Metadata** | text_type, text_mode, text_genre, skill_domain, task_complexity, cognitive_demand, support_level | LLM |
| **Specifications** | support_level, complexity_band | Rules |
| **Quality Metrics** | extraction_method, extraction_timestamp | Automatic |
| **Total** | **23 fields** | **Hybrid** |

**Acknowledging What AI Can and Cannot Do**

#### What AI Does Well ‚úÖ

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying verbs, nouns, and sentence structures
2. **Classification**: Categorizing skills along predefined dimensions
3. **Consistency**: Applying same logic across thousands of skills
4. **Speed**: Processing at scale (minutes, not days)
5. **Cost-Effectiveness**: $9-12 for 3,000 skills vs. $30,000+ for human annotation

#### What AI Struggles With ‚ùå

3. **Novel Categories**: Classifying outside predefined taxonomies
4. **Multi-Dimensional Skills**: Skills spanning multiple domains or complexity levels
5. **Context Dependencies**: Skills requiring knowledge of curriculum scope and sequence

#### Quality Control Strategy

**Hybrid Human-AI Workflow**:

1. **AI First Pass**: Extract metadata for all skills automatically (90%+ accuracy)
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Flag low-confidence extractions for review
3. **Human Validation**: Expert review of flagged items (10-15% of dataset)
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Update prompts and rules based on validation findings
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Track accuracy metrics, retrain as needed

**Validation Checkpoints**:
- Structural consistency checks (all required fields present)
- Logical validation (e.g., poetry can't be expository prose)
- Cross-field coherence (complexity aligns with grade level)
- Sample audits (manual review of random 5% sample)
